# Angry Umbrella - Some Terraform and Related Training

Hello!  This is a collection of things used in Terraform/AWS training.  The assumption is that the user has a basic familiarity with AWS terms and definitions, along with some SSH and command line familiarity.  We will walk through a basic working environment setup, and some basic configuration steps to get started.

The name of this repository is really completely random, but I felt fitting of my professional style and brand.  I put this together to help me better understand a few things, while developing content to be used in the future.  I hope you enjoy this training.

I'm using some stuff from here: [blog.gruntwork.io](https://blog.gruntwork.io/)
I'm also using some stuff from here: [github.com/gmaentz/terraform_training](https://github.com/gmaentz/terraform_training/)
